CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /Users/kouyang/CLionProjects/badminton-court-detection/cmake-build-debug/_deps/opencv-subbuild/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /Users/kouyang/Desktop/Monotrack/court-detection/cmake-build-debug/_deps/opencv-subbuild where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
